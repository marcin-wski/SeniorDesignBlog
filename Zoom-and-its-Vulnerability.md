# What is Zoom

Founded in 2011 Zoom is one of the most, if not the most, popular videoconferencing applications in modern enterprise video communications. With an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, chat, and webinars across mobile devices, desktops, telephones, and room systems Zoom brings videoconferencing to a completely new level and is used by many companies, school, research groups, organizations etc. Zoom Rooms is the original software-based conference room solution used around the world in board, conference, huddle, and training rooms, as well as executive offices and classrooms.

# What was the vulnerability?

It's been found that Zoom had a particular security flew that could have allowed a potential hacker to join a video meeting uninvited and listen in, potentially accessing any files or information shared during the meeting. Since Zoom is one of the most common videoconferencing apps, this finding raised a lot of deeper concerns about the safety of videoconferencing apps that require access to microphones and cameras. 

## How did it work?

Each Zoom call has a randomly generated ID number between 9 and 11 digits long that’s used by participants as a kind of address to locate and join a specific call. The security researchers looking into this found a way to predict which were valid meetings about 4 percent of the time and were able to join some of them. The implications are that if you’re having a video chat and have multiple members joining, you may not notice if someone who isn’t supposed to be there is sitting there listening to you.

## The resolution

The security research team has disclosed the vulnerability to Zoom, and it says the company responded quickly to fix the issue. It replaced the randomized generation of meeting ID numbers with a “cryptographically strong” one, added more digits to meeting ID numbers, and made requiring passwords the default for future meetings.

It’s no longer possible to scan for random meeting IDs the way the researchers did; each attempt to join will load a meeting page, and repeated attempts to try to scan for meeting IDs will temporarily block that device from the platform.
