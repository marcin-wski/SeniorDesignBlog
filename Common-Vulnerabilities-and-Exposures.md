# What is a CVE

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) launched in 1999 by MITRE, a nonprofit that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government, is a system providing a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. The National Cybersecurity FFRDC, operated by the Mitre Corporation, maintains the system, with funding from the National Cyber Security Division of the United States Department of Homeland Security.

The Security Content Automation Protocol uses CVE, and CVE IDs are listed on MITRE's system as well as in the US National Vulnerability Database. 

The system has been created to identify and catalog vulnerabilities in software or firmware into a free “dictionary” for organizations to improve their security.

The dictionary’s main purpose is to standardize the way each known vulnerability or exposure is identified. Standard IDs allow security administrators to access technical information about a specific threat across multiple CVE-compatible information sources.

# What is a vulnerability and exposure

A vulnerability is a mistake in software code that provides an attacker with direct access to a system or network. It could allow an attacker to pose as a super-user or system administrator with full access privileges. An exposure on the other hand is a mistake that gives an attacker indirect access to a system or network. It could allow an attacker to gather customer information that could be sold.

# What is a CVE listing? 

CVE isn't just another vulnerability database. It is designed to allow vulnerability databases and other capabilities to be linked together, and to facilitate the comparison of security tools and services. A CVE listing only contains the standard identifier number with status indicator, a brief description and references to related vulnerability reports and advisories. It does not include risk, impact, fix or detailed technical information. The US National Vulnerability Database (NVD) does include fix, scoring, and other information for identifiers on the CVE List.

# Can hackers use the CVE to break into networks?

The short answer is yes, but MITRE and the CVE board contend that the benefits of CVE outweigh the risks:

- CVE lists only publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures, which means skilled hackers likely know about them anyway.
- It takes much more work for an organization to protect its networks and fix all possible holes than it takes for a hacker to find a single vulnerability, exploit it, and compromise the network.
- There is growing agreement in the infosec community that sharing information is beneficial. This is reflected in the fact that the CVE Board and CNAs include key infosec organizations.

# How can CVE help protect networks?

By using the CVE ID for a particular vulnerability or exposure, organizations can quickly and accurately obtain information from a variety of CVE-Compatible information sources. By facilitating better comparisons between different security tools and services, CVE can help an organization choose what are the most appropriate for its needs.

Using CVE-Compatible products and services also helps improve responses to security advisories. If the advisory is CVE-Compatible, organizations can see if their scanners or security services check for this threat and then determine whether their intrusion detection systems have the appropriate attack signatures. For those that build or maintain systems for customers, the CVE compatibility of advisories will help directly identify any fixes from the vendors of the commercial software products in those systems. That also requires the vendor fix site to be CVE-Compatible.
